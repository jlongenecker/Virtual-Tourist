# Virtual-Tourist

Virtual Tourist is a project built to satisfy Udacity's iOS Nanodegree Lesson 4 [project](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-persistence-and-core-data--ud325). The app allows a user to drop a pin on
a map which causes pictures with that pins geolocation to be downloaded in the background. 

## Installation

Clone Git Repository and then open with Xcode. The repository requries Xcode 7.3 or later.

## Collaboration

Since this project meets Udacity's objectives for lesson 4, this project is complete. Additional work can continue to be contributed
and the repository will be monitored. 

## Known Issues

* Selecting and deselecting a pin appears to be inconsistent, however, is limited this project's implementation of both selecting 
and moving a pin.
